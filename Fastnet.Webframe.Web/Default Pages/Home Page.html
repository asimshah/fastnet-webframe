    <h2>
        Welcome to your new Webframe site
    </h2>

    <p>
        This home, or “landing page”, has been set up for you by
        default when the site was created. It can be found in the folder “Site Pages”
        which has been created in the site’s Storage area. The name of the page is
        “Home Page”. You will also find another page there called “Site Banner” which
        is the page you see above the menu bar.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both pages have been created using Microsoft Word 2007. They
        can be readily edited to change the content as you wish. Alternatively you can
        create your own pages as replacements for these.
    </p>

        Customising your site
    </h2>

    <p>
        To change these pages or add new ones you will need to run
        the Webframe Studio. This can be run by clicking here: <a href="/studio">Webframe Studio</a>. The Studio is a Silverlight application and you will be asked to
        install Silverlight from the Microsoft site if you haven’t previously done so.
        Please note that a large number of Windows PC’s already have Silverlight installed.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you run Webframe Studio you will be asked to login – if
        you do not have login credentials please contact the person who is the
        administrator of this site, or email Mike Battye at <a href="mailto:mbattye@webframe.co.uk">mbattye@webframe.co.uk</a>.
