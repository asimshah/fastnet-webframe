    <h2>
        Welcome to your new Webframe site
    </h2>
    <p>
        This home, or “landing page”, has been set up for you by
        default when the site was created. It can be found in the root folder of the
        site Store.
    </p>
    <p>
        This “landing page” also has content in two of its associated panels: banner content and left panel content.
        The site has been created with the right panel turned off.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Customising your site
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can customise the site by editing these pages and creating additional pages that can be hyperlinked. You can also make changes to the look of the site by editing the css used for
        each of the panels and you can create menus.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            You need to be both logged in and be a member of the requisite group to make these changes: the Editors group to edit page content and the
            Designers group to alter the look of the site or create and edit menus.

        <i>The Administrator is always a member of both groups.</i>
