<p>
    This designer can used to modify the layout of the site and specify its appearance. This includes the panel structure as well as details such as sizes,
    colours, borders, and so on.
Site design is specified entirely in CSS and good understanding of CSS is necessary to ensure the desired results.</p>
<h2>Site Layout</h2>
<p>
    Site layout can be modified using the Layout editor ("Layout" link above). Site content is rendered within a set of panels
    and relationship between the panels is an important aspect of understanding how layout can be modified.
</p>
<p>There are a number of panels of which the most important are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the Banner panel - if shown this always appears at the top of the page across the browser window</li>
    <li>the Menu panel - if shown this appears just below the Banner panel</li>
    <li>the Left panel - if shown this appears as a left column</li>
    <li>the Centre panel - the primary content is always shown in this panel</li>
    <li>the Right panel - if shown, this appears as a right column</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these, except the Centre panel, is optional. </p>
<h2>Menus</h2>
<p>
    Menus can be added to the site,if required. These are displayed in the Menu panel and laid out horizontally.
    Any sub-menus appear below the parent menu and are shown when the parent menu is clicked.
</p>
<p>Menu styles can be specified in the Menu panel using the Layout editor. The menu items themselves are specified using the Menu editor ("Menus" link above).</p>
